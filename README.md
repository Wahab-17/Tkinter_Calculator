Calculator App using Tkinter (Python) 📌 Project Description

This is a simple Calculator application developed using Python Tkinter for the graphical user interface. The project is implemented using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as classes and methods to ensure modularity, reusability, and clean code structure.

The calculator performs basic arithmetic operations with a user-friendly interface.

🚀 Features

Addition (+)

Subtraction (-)

Multiplication (*)

Division (/)

Clear button (C)

Real-time display update

Error handling for invalid inputs

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 3

Tkinter (Standard Python GUI library)

Object-Oriented Programming (Classes & Methods)

🧠 OOP Concepts Used

Class: A main Calculator class is created to define the application.

Methods: Separate methods are used for:

Handling button clicks

Performing calculations

Clearing display

Updating the GUI

Encapsulation: All functionalities are wrapped inside the class.

▶️ How to Run the Project

Make sure Python is installed on your system.

Download or clone the repository.

Open terminal/command prompt in the project folder.

Run:

python filename.py

📷 Output

The application opens a calculator window with buttons and display similar to a standard calculator.
